exam becomes a ""formality"" somewhat. not sure anymore on the order, pero i remember taking tests.. iqlogic. math algebra, geometry, arithmetic. english spelling, grammar, reading comprehension. science this is for some programs only. i took the exam with other takers and they did not have this part. essay very specific on the program you applied. this one took the longest. all of them have time-limits, with the essay taking the longest. the english exam was the longest. iirc, the exam started at am and ended at noon. the ""hardest"" was probably the english exam, mostly because of the length, but also because you have to have near mastery of the english language to score high. the essay tests your theoretical knowledge in the program you're applying for, and also if you're updated on the current trends in research and industry. you're given prompts, and you are to write an essay regarding one of the said prompts. as i said, if you've done well in your undergrad, you probably won't be doing bad on this exam. idk how much weight the results of those exams would have on your admission to the program since different departments are run by different chairpersons with differing priorities. in my case, the exam results were a ""formality,"" what mattered most was the interview with the chairperson which comes afterward. my interview experience was quite casual. the chairperson asked me about my undergrad experience, motivation to get a higher degree, goals during and after graduation, andmost importantlymy research plans. i emphasize the research plans because a ched memo took effect a year or so ago which mandated that grad students must have been published in a peer-reviewed journalpublication before they can apply for thesisdissertation defense. this means that you can't graduate if you are not published. two weeks back, usc had an online orientation which stated that the publication requirement for the grad students must be with a peer-reviewed and indexed journal. i won't get into the technical details on journal indexing, but this means that the students' publications must be of a higher quality. this is because most journals and publications are peer-reviewed, but not all are indexed. typically, the journals that are indexed have more stringent review processes thus somewhat low acceptance rate andor have quite expensive publication fees typically ranging from php, to php,. so yeah, i suggest not to worry about the exam that much. instead, focus more on what research you want to do as a grad student. try to find what recent publications and projects the faculty of the program you're applying to have done or are doing, and communicate with them if possible. the interview with the chairperson could also be your
