How difficult is the admission exam for Master's?,"i took mine almost a year ago now. i don't know if they are going to change it, pero it was basically your regular college entrance exam. if you did well in your undergrad, i think the grad entrance exam becomes a ""formality"" somewhat. not sure anymore on the order, pero i remember taking tests.. iqlogic. math algebra, geometry, arithmetic. english spelling, grammar, reading comprehension. science this is for some programs only. i took the exam with other takers and they did not have this part. essay very specific on the program you applied. this one took the longest. all of them have time-limits, with the essay taking the longest. the english exam was the longest. iirc, the exam started at am and ended at noon. the ""hardest"" was probably the english exam, mostly because of the length, but also because you have to have near mastery of the english language to score high. the essay tests your theoretical knowledge in the program you're applying for, and also if you're updated on the current trends in research and industry. you're given prompts, and you are to write an essay regarding one of the said prompts. as i said, if you've done well in your undergrad, you probably won't be doing bad on this exam. idk how much weight the results of those exams would have on your admission to the program since different departments are run by different chairpersons with differing priorities. in my case, the exam results were a ""formality,"" what mattered most was the interview with the chairperson which comes afterward. my interview experience was quite casual. the chairperson asked me about my undergrad experience, motivation to get a higher degree, goals during and after graduation, andmost importantlymy research plans. i emphasize the research plans because a ched memo took effect a year or so ago which mandated that grad students must have been published in a peer-reviewed journalpublication before they can apply for thesisdissertation defense. this means that you can't graduate if you are not published. two weeks back, usc had an online orientation which stated that the publication requirement for the grad students must be with a peer-reviewed and indexed journal. i won't get into the technical details on journal indexing, but this means that the students' publications must be of a higher quality. this is because most journals and publications are peer-reviewed, but not all are indexed. typically, the journals that are indexed have more stringent review processes thus somewhat low acceptance rate andor have quite expensive publication fees typically ranging from php, to php,. so yeah, i suggest not to worry about the exam that much. instead, focus more on what research you want to do as a grad student. try to find what recent publications and projects the faculty of the program you're applying to have done or are doing, and communicate with them if possible. the interview with the chairperson could also be your introduction to the research done by yhe departmentprogram. in any case, see you around the campus!",TRUE,comment,"i took mine almost a year ago now.

The Philippines being under the United States would not make the country more successful,"on july, the united states proclaimed the philippines' independence, ending its -year colonization of our country. every year, news sites like abs-cbn, gma, or rappler post about the philippine independence from the united states. often, in the comments you see a lot of people claiming that the philippines should have stayed a part of the united states; often citing the corrupt governance or citing the united states' status as a first world country and our own status as a third world country as reasons for why we should've remained a state. however, i think a lot of these people are greatly uninformed or misinformed. it's frustrating to read. not just on the th of july, but anytime the philippines is spoken in the same breath as the united states. in my opinion, there are many reasons why the philippines would not have been better off under the united states' occupation. the reason behind my opinion are as follows:. statehood a reoccurring comment about the us occupation of the philippines is how state na sana tayo ngayon. this is largely false. yes, hawaii and alaska were inducted into the united states in, years after our independence. however, there are some facts present that show why the philippines would not have been inducted into statehood. for example, during the bombing at pearl harbor, manila was expressly mentioned in former us president franklin d. roosevelt's ""day of infamy"" speech. however, it is later crossed out, leaving only a mention of hawaii. another fact that points against the philippines' statehood is how outlying territories ones that are not close to the continental united states were never considered into statehood. these territories include puerto rico, the virgin islands, american samoa, and guam. even if we stayed a territory of the united states, we would never get statehood. puerto rico and washington d. c. in recent years have been considered for statehood, but it never passes because of how a st state will drastically affect the electoral college. although, the philippines can be a territory but it comes with its own issues.. inability to vote in national elections u. s. territories cannot vote for the national election, meaning, they have no say in who's the president and who represents them in congress. although there are some territories with representation in congress, however, they cannot vote on any bills. this is bad because territories often heavily rely on federal aid from the government. any cut on federal funding, like we've seen recently under the trump administration, can heavily cripple the economy of these territories. what's worse, they have no say in those cuts.. the jones act the jones act is a federal law that restricts foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between the us and other territories such as puerto rico and guam. this makes shipping of goods very expensive. often doubling the price of goods once they arrive in the territory and raising the cost of living to more than the main land united states. the philippines being an archipelago far detached from the mainland us would make it susceptible to the insane price gauging that results from the jones act.. the compact of free association the compact of free association or ""cofa"" is a special relationship between the united states and three pacific island nations - the federated states of micronesia, the marshall islands, and palau. this allows citizens of these three nations free entry into the united states. if the philippines were a territory of the united states, cofa migrants would be allowed free entry into the country. this isn't a big issue in itself. however, in guam for example, there is an overrepresentation of cofa migrants in prison. there is also a sizeable number of homeless cofa migrants on guam. so, if the philippines were a territory, that means we'd have people who can freely enter the country, which may double our already bloated prison system and our already overpopulated squatters areas. but it's the united states, right? poverty will be the thing of the past! we're a first world country! there's no corruption!. homelessness and poverty there has been a rise in a steady rise in homelessness in the us. and as the cost of living rises and the minimum wage stays the same, more and more people have reported being below the poverty line. this is a well-documented struggle in the states that often gets overlooked.. corruption corruption in the united states is difficult to discuss without explaining the federal system. if you were active online during the philippine election, you would no doubt remember that former president rodrigo duterte wanted to change the philippine's system into a federalist one. although, leaked versions of their new constitution in showed that his version of ""federalism"" did not aim to divide the country into a national federal and state government, but rather simply as a ploy to extend term limits. in the united states there are two seperate but co-equal bodies of government. the federal and state government. the federal government is nationwide, and the state governments are for each of the states. if the philippines were a territory, we'd be under both the us national government and our own territorial government led by a governor. because of this divide and certain parts of the united states constitution that grants powers and protections to the state government, there are some laws that only the state can make and some laws that the federal government has supreme power to control. this means, on top of the national federal tax, the state government of the philippines can issue its own state taxes. the philippine state government also has control on how education is handled in the country. so, our current issues with absurd taxation and the education crisis will continue to persist even if we were a us territory. even the issue of political dynasties will not only persist, but worsen as now we would only be held by our state congress and a governor. with how families control a single province in the philippines now, there is no stopping a single family from practically ruling the philippines if it were a territory. in fact, oligarchies like the villars will continue to exist in a us driven philippines especially with favorable to big businesses most us laws are. we see that with billionaires barely paying taxes that matches their net worth. again, use our neighbor guam as an example where families like the leon guerrero, calvo, and camacho practically run the island, both being in government and in big businesses. and often, those in washington do not provide major oversight to its territories. we will be left alone to our own devises under the rule of one family. but what if somehow we were a state. just what if? then couldn't we be better off?. the electoral college barring everything i said about federalism and how it can be used by oligarchs, an issue the united states as a country face is its lack of direct democracy. in every election, the people do not actually vote for their president. instead, the people vote for electors who promise to support that candidate. each state gets a certain number of electoral votes based on population. to win the presidency for example, the candidate must get at least electoral votes. electors are not politicians or government officials, in the most honest sense, they are just guys. remember in when two rival political parties won the presidency and vice presidency with duterte and leni? in a us system, you vote for a tandem. if the president wins, their vice president wins by default. there are plenty of other issues with the united states as a whole and being a territory that does not make it enticing for the philippines to be a territory. this doesn't even go deeper into things such as the philippines becoming a close target for north korea if it ever wanted to attack the united states, or how the united states only has two parties, the democrats and republicans, and they have been in a state of absolute deadlock in congress for decades so no progressive bill ever gets passed, or how lawmakers and judges have stocks in private prisons which incentivizes them to support laws that will put more people into those prisons, or how slavery is technically legal if you're an inmate, or how medical insurance is not universal and there are doctors in hospitals are not covered by your insurance despite the hospital being covered, or just entire can of worms that is national student loan debt. i'm not a hater of the united states. this is just reality, and the reality is that a lot of filipinos who sing its praises are misinformed or uninformed. and this isn't about immigration or being an ofw, that's its own thing. this is very specifically the philippines as a state or territory of the united states.",TRUE,post,"on july, the united states proclaimed the philippines' independence, ending its one-year colonization of our country. every year, news sites like abs-cbn, gma, or rappler post about the philippine independence from the united states. often, in the comments you see a lot of people claiming that the Philippines should have stayed a part of the United States; often citing the corrupt governance or citing the United States' status as a first world country and our own status as a third world country as reasons for why we should've remained a state. however, I think a lot of these people are greatly uninformed or misinformed. it's frustrating to read. not just on the th of july, but anytime the philippines is spoken in the same breath as the united states. in my opinion, there are many reasons why the philippines would not have been better off under the united states' occupation. the reason behind my opinion are as follows: statehood a reoccurring comment about the us occupation of the philippines is how state we would have been now. this is largely false. yes, hawaii and alaska were inducted into the united states in, years after our independence. however, there are some facts present that show why the Philippines would not have been inducted into statehood. for example, during the bombing at pearl harbor, manila was expressly mentioned in former us president franklin d. roosevelt's ""day of infamy"" speech. however, it is later crossed out, leaving only a mention of Hawaii. another fact that points against the Philippines' statehood is how outlying territories ones that are not close to the continental united states were never considered into statehood.

That's full of grammatically incorrect, wrongly used punctuations. etc. a mother also shared something about her son who is in elementary school and his teacher. The lesson at that time was about involuntary muscles and voluntary muscles. The teacher said an example of voluntary muscles is the heart and involuntary muscles are the arms and legs. The child was confused by what the teacher said because he knew that was wrong. vice versa. The child told his mother about it, the next day the mother went to school to talk about it in a nice way. The teacher really insists that he is right and the student is wrong, that's what the books say. then they suggest that they check on google, the teacher is really wrong. although, during that subject again, he corrected his mistake, that the student was right. there are teachers who only rely on one resource, there are teachers who are lazy to read the lessons they are going to teach. sometimes their resources are erratic and that's just where they base themselves. It is also good that the parents have a guide in the child's studies. I have the same experience when I was in elementary school, but I can't remember what it was about. I knew that the teacher was really wrong, but I was too shy, so I just let it go."

"I think I'm in Stage 2 of Sleep Paralysis, and I'm starting to understand my sister’s warning.","i respect that some of you are believers of the supernatural, but i tend to lean on the scientific. so when we sleep and reach the rem cycle, our brain paralyzes our body so we don't act out our dreams and hurt ourselces. but sometimes, things get out of sync. we suddenly wake up during rem while our muscles are still paralyzed so we can't move even if we are fully conscious. this can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. it is also common to hallucinate or have a bit of difficulty breathing during sleep paralysis. remember na your body is still in dream mode when you suddenly woke up. so the brain is still actively creating dreams nung nagising ka. this is most likely why we tend to see shadowy figures or other sort of creatures. when i experienced it, i saw a small creature hopping around the room. but it's not real: it's just a hallucination. as for the choking sensation, like i said, paralyzed pa yung muscles mo so it can really feel like you're choking or that something is sitting on your chest. your chest muscles may be paralyzed but the diaphragm is still working so you are definitely breathing even if it does feel like you can't. now the common reasons why sleep paralysis happens are: -excessive fatigue, stress, andor anxiety -not getting enough sleep -irregular sleep schedules or patterns -sleeping on your back if it happens to you, you just need to relax. i know that sounds cliche but what else can we do, right? breathe normally and focus on trying to move one body part at a time. i usually start din with my big toe. once i am able to move it, sunod sunod na yan. also, try to ignore whatever it is you see. ako i keep telling myself ""it's not real"". for some, prayer gives them comfort so you can do that too, basta anything that helps you relax. if it keeps happening, like with your sister, maybe take a look na talaga at your lifestyle or consider seeing a sleep specialist about it. hope this helped.",TRUE,comment,"I respect that some of you are believers of the supernatural, but I tend to lean on the scientific. so when we sleep and reach the rem cycle, our brain paralyzes our body so we don't act out our dreams and hurt our souls. but sometimes, things get out of sync. we suddenly wake up during rem while our muscles are still paralyzed so we can't move even if we are fully conscious. this can last for a few seconds to a few minutes. it is also common to hallucinate or have a bit of difficulty breathing during sleep paralysis. remember that your body is still in dream mode when you suddenly wake up. so the brain is still actively creating dreams when you wake up. this is most likely why we tend to see shadowy figures or other sorts of creatures. when i experienced it, i saw a small creature hopping around the room. but it's not real: it's just a hallucination. as for the choking sensation, like i said, your muscles are still paralyzed so it can really feel like you're choking or that something is sitting on your chest. your chest muscles may be paralyzed but the diaphragm is still working so you are definitely breathing even if it feels like you can't. now the common reasons why sleep paralysis happens are: -excessive fatigue, stress, and anxiety -not getting enough sleep -irregular sleep schedules or patterns -sleeping on your back if it happens to you, you just need to relax. i know that sounds cliche but what else can we do, right? breathe normally and focus on trying to move one body part at a time. i usually also start with my big toe. once i am able to move it, that's next. also, try to ignore whatever it is you see.
