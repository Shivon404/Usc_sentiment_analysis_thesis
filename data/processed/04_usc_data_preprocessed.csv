took mine almost a year ago now. i don't know if they are going to change it, pero it was basically your regular college entrance exam. if you did well in your undergrad, i think the grad entrance exam becomes a ""formality"" somewhat. not sure anymore on the order, pero i remember taking tests.. iqlogic. math algebra, geometry, arithmetic. english spelling, grammar, reading comprehension. science this is for some programs only. i took the exam with other takers and they did not have this part. essay very specific on the program you applied. this one took the longest. all of them have time-limits, with the essay taking the longest. the english exam was the longest. iirc, the exam started at am and ended at noon. the ""hardest"" was probably the english exam, mostly because of the length, but also because you have to have near mastery of the english language to score high. the essay tests your theoretical knowledge in the program you're applying for, and also if you're updated on the current trends in research and industry. you're given prompts, and you are to write an essay regarding one of the said prompts. as i said, if you've done well in your undergrad, you probably won't be doing bad on this exam. idk how much weight the results of those exams would have on your admission to the program since different departments are run by different chairpersons with differing priorities. in my case, the exam results were a ""formality,"" what mattered most was the interview with the chairperson which comes afterward. my interview experience was quite casual. the chairperson asked me about my undergrad experience, motivation to get a higher degree, goals during and after graduation, andmost importantlymy research plans. i emphasize the research plans because a ched memo took effect a year or so ago which mandated that grad students must have been published in a peer-reviewed journalpublication before they can apply for thesisdissertation defense. this means that you can't graduate if you are not published. two weeks back, usc had an online orientation which stated that the publication requirement for the grad students must be with a peer-reviewed and indexed journal. i won't get into the technical details on journal indexing, but this means that the students' publications must be of a higher quality. this is because most journals and publications are peer-reviewed, but not all are indexed. typically, the journals that are indexed have more stringent review processes thus somewhat low acceptance rate andor have quite expensive publication fees typically ranging from php, to php,. so yeah, i suggest not to worry about the exam that much. instead, focus more on what research you want to do as a grad student. try to find what recent publications and projects the faculty of the program you're applying to have done or are doing, and communicate with them if possible. the interview with the chairperson could also be your

I took the exam with other takers and they did not have this part. essay very specific on the program you applied. this one took the longest. all of them have time-limits, with the essay taking the longest. the english exam was the longest. iirc, the exam started at am and ended at noon. the ""hardest"" was probably the english exam, mostly because of the length, but also because you have to have near mastery of the english language to score high. the essay tests your theoretical knowledge in the program you're applying for, and also if you're updated on the current trends in research and industry. you're given prompts, and you are to write an essay regarding one of the said prompts. as i said, if you've done well in your undergrad, you probably won't be doing bad on this exam. idk how much weight the results of those exams would have on your admission to the program since different departments are run by different chairpersons with differing priorities. in my case, the exam results were a ""formality,"" what mattered most was the interview with the chairperson which came afterwards. my interview experience was quite casual. the chairperson asked me about my undergrad experience, motivation to get a higher degree, goals during and after graduation, and most importantly my research plans. I emphasize the research plans because a ched memo took effect a year or so ago which mandated that grad students must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal publication before they can apply for thesisdissertation defense. this means that you can't graduate if you are not published. two weeks back, usc had an online orientation which stated that the publication requirement for the grad students must be with a peer-reviewed and indexed journal. I won't get into the technical details on journal indexing, but this means that the students' publications must be of a higher quality. this is because most journals and publications are peer-reviewed, but not all are indexed. typically, the journals that are indexed have more stringent review processes thus somewhat low acceptance rate and have quite expensive publication fees typically ranging from php, to php,. so yeah, i suggest not to worry about the exam that much. instead, focus more on what research you want to do as a grad student. try to find what recent publications and projects the faculty of the program you're applying to have done or are doing, and communicate with them if possible. the interview with the chairperson could also be your introduction to the research done by the department program. in any case, see you around the campus!",took mine almost year ago dont know going change basically regular college entrance exam well undergrad think grad entrance exam becomes formality somewhat sure anymore order remember taking test iqlogic math algebra geometry arithmetic english spelling grammar reading comprehension science program took exam taker part essay specific program applied one took longest timelimits essay taking longest english exam longest iirc exam started ended noon hardest probably english exam mostly length also near mastery english language score high essay test theoretical knowledge program youre applying also youre updated current trend research industry youre given prompt write essay regarding one said prompt said youve done well undergrad probably wont bad exam much weight result exam would admission program since different department run different chairperson differing priority case exam result formality mattered interview chairperson came afterwards interview experience quite casual chairperson asked undergrad experience motivation get higher degree goal graduation importantly research plan emphasize research plan ched memo took effect year ago mandated grad student must published peerreviewed journal publication apply thesisdissertation defense mean cant graduate published two week back usc online orientation stated publication requirement grad student must peerreviewed indexed journal wont get technical detail journal indexing mean student publication must higher quality journal publication peerreviewed indexed typically journal indexed stringent review process thus somewhat low acceptance rate quite expensive publication fee typically ranging php php yeah suggest worry exam much instead focus research want grad student try find recent publication project faculty program youre applying done communicate possible interview chairperson could also introduction research done department program case see around campus

july, the united states proclaimed the philippines' independence, ending its -year colonization of our country. every year, news sites like abs-cbn, gma, or rappler post about the philippine independence from the united states. often, in the comments you see a lot of people claiming that the philippines should have stayed a part of the united states; often citing the corrupt governance or citing the united states' status as a first world country and our own status as a third world country as reasons for why we should've remained a state. however, i think a lot of these people are greatly uninformed or misinformed. it's frustrating to read. not just on the th of july, but anytime the philippines is spoken in the same breath as the united states. in my opinion, there are many reasons why the philippines would not have been better off under the united states' occupation. the reason behind my opinion are as follows:. statehood a reoccurring comment about the us occupation of the philippines is how state na sana tayo ngayon. this is largely false. yes, hawaii and alaska were inducted into the united states in, years after our independence. however, there are some facts present that show why the philippines would not have been inducted into statehood. for example, during the bombing at pearl harbor, manila was expressly mentioned in former us president franklin d. roosevelt's ""day of infamy"" speech. however, it is later crossed out, leaving only a mention of hawaii. another fact that points against the philippines' statehood is how outlying territories ones that are not close to the continental united states were never considered into statehood. these territories include puerto rico, the virgin islands, american samoa, and guam. even if we stayed a territory of the united states, we would never get statehood. puerto rico and washington d. c. in recent years have been considered for statehood, but it never passes because of how a st state will drastically affect the electoral college. although, the philippines can be a territory but it comes with its own issues.. inability to vote in national elections u. s. territories cannot vote for the national election, meaning, they have no say in who's the president and who represents them in congress. although there are some territories with representation in congress, however, they cannot vote on any bills. this is bad because territories often heavily rely on federal aid from the government. any cut on federal funding, like we've seen recently under the trump administration, can heavily cripple the economy of these territories. what's worse, they have no say in those cuts.. the jones act the jones act is a federal law that restricts foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between the us and other territories such as puerto rico and guam. this makes shipping of goods very expensive. often doubling the price of goods once they arrive in the territory and raising the cost of living to more than the main land united states. the philippines being an archipelago far detached from the mainland us would make it susceptible to the insane price gauging that results from the jones act.. the compact of free association the compact of free association or ""cofa"" is a special relationship between the united states and three pacific island nations - the federated states of micronesia, the marshall islands, and palau. this allows citizens of these three nations free entry into the united states. if the philippines were a territory of the united states, cofa migrants would be allowed free entry into the country. this isn't a big issue in itself. however, in guam for example, there is an overrepresentation of cofa migrants in prison. there is also a sizeable number of homeless cofa migrants on guam. so, if the philippines were a territory, that means we'd have people who can freely enter the country, which may double our already bloated prison system and our already overpopulated squatters areas. but it's the united states, right? poverty will be the thing of the past! we're a first world country! there's no corruption!. homelessness and poverty there has been a rise in a steady rise in homelessness in the us. and as the cost of living rises and the minimum wage stays the same, more and more people have reported being below the poverty line. this is a well-documented struggle in the states that often gets overlooked.. corruption corruption in the united states is difficult to discuss without explaining the federal system. if you were active online during the philippine election, you would no doubt remember that former president rodrigo duterte wanted to change the philippine's system into a federalist one. although, leaked versions of their new constitution in showed that his version of ""federalism"" did not aim to divide the country into a national federal and state government, but rather simply as a ploy to extend term limits. in the united states there are two seperate but co-equal bodies of government. the federal and state government. the federal government is nationwide, and the state governments are for each of the states. if the philippines were a territory, we'd be under both the us national government and our own territorial government led by a governor. because of this divide and certain parts of the united states constitution that grants powers and protections to the state government, there are some laws that only the state can make and some laws that the federal government has supreme power to control. this means, on top of the national federal tax, the state government of the philippines can issue its own state taxes. the philippine state government also has control on how education is handled in the country. so, our current issues with absurd taxation and the education crisis will continue to persist even if we were a us territory. even the issue of political dynasties will not only persist, but worsen as now we would only be held by our state congress and a governor. with how families control a single province in the philippines now, there is no stopping a single family from practically ruling the philippines if it were a territory. in fact, oligarchies like the villars will continue to exist in a us driven philippines especially with favorable to big businesses most us laws are. we see that with billionaires barely paying taxes that matches their net worth. again, use our neighbor guam as an example where families like the leon guerrero, calvo, and camacho practically run the island, both being in government and in big businesses. and often, those in washington do not provide major oversight to its territories. we will be left alone to our own devises under the rule of one family. but what if somehow we were a state. just what if? then couldn't we be better off?. the electoral college barring everything i said about federalism and how it can be used by oligarchs, an issue the united states as a country face is its lack of direct democracy. in every election, the people do not actually vote for their president. instead, the people vote for electors who promise to support that candidate. each state gets a certain number of electoral votes based on population. to win the presidency for example, the candidate must get at least electoral votes. electors are not politicians or government officials, in the most honest sense, they are just guys. remember in when two rival political parties won the presidency and vice presidency with duterte and leni? in a us system, you vote for a tandem. if the president wins, their vice president wins by default. there are plenty of other issues with the united states as a whole and being a territory that does not make it enticing for the philippines to be a territory. this doesn't even go deeper into things such as the philippines becoming a close target for north korea if it ever wanted to attack the united states, or how the united states only has two parties, the democrats and republicans, and they have been in a state of absolute deadlock in congress for decades so no progressive bill ever gets passed, or how lawmakers and judges have stocks in private prisons which incentivizes them to support laws that will put more people into those prisons, or how slavery is technically legal if you're an inmate, or how medical insurance is not universal and there are doctors in hospitals are not covered by your insurance despite the hospital being covered, or just entire can of worms that is national student loan debt. i'm not a hater of the united states. this is just reality, and the reality is that a lot of filipinos who sing its praises are misinformed or uninformed. and this isn't about immigration or being an ofw, that's its own thing. this is very specifically the philippines as a state or territory of the united states.","the philippines being under the united states would

These territories include Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam. even if we stayed a territory of the united states, we would never get statehood. puerto rico and washington d. c. in recent years have been considered for statehood, but it never passes because of how a st state will drastically affect the electoral college. although, the philippines can be a territory but it comes with its own issues.. inability to vote in national elections u. s. territories cannot vote for the national election, meaning, they have no say in who's the president and who represents them in congress. although there are some territories with representation in congress, however, they cannot vote on any bills. this is bad because territories often rely heavily on federal aid from the government. any cut on federal funding, like we've seen recently under the trump administration, can heavily cripple the economy of these territories. what's worse, they have no say in those cuts.. the jones act the jones act is a federal law that restricts foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between the us and other territories such as puerto rico and guam. this makes shipping of goods very expensive. often doubling the price of goods once they arrive in the territory and raising the cost of living to more than the main land united states. the philippines being an archipelago far detached from the mainland us would make it susceptible to the insane price gauging that results from the jones act.. the compact of free association the compact of free association or ""cofa"" is a special relationship between the united states and three pacific island nations - the federated states of micronesia, the marshall islands, and palau. this allows citizens of these three nations free entry into the united states. if the philippines were a territory of the united states, cofa migrants would be allowed free entry into the country. this isn't a big issue in itself. however, in Guam for example, there is an overrepresentation of cofa migrants in prison. there is also a sizeable number of homeless cofa migrants on guam. so, if the philippines were a territory, that means we'd have people who can freely enter the country, which may double our already bloated prison system and our already overpopulated squatters areas. but it's the united states, right? poverty will be the thing of the past! we're a first world country! there's no corruption! homelessness and poverty there has been a rise in a steady rise in homelessness in the us. and as the cost of living rises and the minimum wage stays the same, more and more people have reported being below the poverty line. this is a well-documented struggle in the states that often gets overlooked.. corruption corruption in the united states is difficult to discuss without explaining the federal system. if you were active online during the philippine election, you would no doubt remember that former president rodrigo duterte wanted to change the philippine's system into a federalist one. although, leaked versions of their new constitution showed that his version of ""federalism"" did not aim to divide the country into a national federal and state government, but rather simply as a ploy to extend term limits. in the united states there are two separate but co-equal bodies of government. the federal and state government. the federal government is nationwide, and the state governments are for each of the states. if the philippines were a territory, we'd be under both the us national government and our own territorial government led by a governor. because of this divide and certain parts of the united states constitution that grants powers and protections to the state government, there are some laws that only the state can make and some laws that the federal government has supreme power to control. this means, on top of the national federal tax, the state government of the Philippines can issue its own state taxes. The Philippine state government also has control over how education is handled in the country. so, our current issues with absurd taxation and the education crisis will continue to persist even if we were a us territory. even the issue of political dynasties will not only persist, but worsen as now we would only be held by our state congress and a governor. with how families control a single province in the philippines now, there is no stopping a single family from practically ruling the philippines if it were a territory. in fact, oligarchies like the Villars will continue to exist in a us driven Philippines especially with favorable to big businesses most us laws are. we see that with billionaires barely paying taxes that matches their net worth. again, use our neighbor guam as an example where families like the leon guerrero, calvo, and camacho practically run the island, both being in government and in big businesses. and often, those in washington do not provide major oversight to its territories. we will be left alone to our own devises under the rule of one family. but what if somehow we were a state. just what if? then couldn't we be better off?. the electoral college barring everything i said about federalism and how it can be used by oligarchs, an issue the united states as a country faces is its lack of direct democracy. in every election, the people do not actually vote for their president. instead, the people vote for electors who promise to support that candidate. each state gets a certain number of electoral votes based on population. to win the presidency for example, the candidate must get at least electoral votes. electors are not politicians or government officials, in the most honest sense, they are just guys. remember when two rival political parties won the presidency and vice presidency with duterte and leni? in a us system, you vote for a tandem. if the president wins, their vice president wins by default. there are plenty of other issues with the united states as a whole and being a territory that does not make it enticing for the philippines to be a territory. this doesn't even go deeper into things such as the philippines becoming a close target for north korea if it ever wanted to attack the united states, or how the united states only has two parties, the democrats and republicans, and they have been in a state of absolute deadlock in congress for decades so no progressive bill ever gets passed, or how lawmakers and judges have stocks in private prisons which incentivizes them to support laws that will put more people into those prisons, or how slavery is technically legal if you're an inmate, or how medical insurance is not universal and there are doctors in hospitals that are not covered by your insurance despite the hospital being covered, or just the entire can of worms that is national student loan debt. i'm not a hater of the united states. this is just reality, and the reality is that a lot of filipinos who sing its praises are misinformed or uninformed. and this isn't about immigration or being an OFW, that's its own thing. this is very specifically the philippines as a state or territory of the united states.",july united state proclaimed philippine independence ending oneyear colonization country every year news site like abscbn gma rappler post philippine independence
