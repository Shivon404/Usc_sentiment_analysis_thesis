I am Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate going into 2nd year. As I just finished my freshman year, take this reply as a grain of salt; I may not be able to provide the proper information you need.

First off, someone/s topping the licensure exams does not necessarily mean that the program is naturally better for all. It’s a sign that—yes—it’s not bad, but nonetheless it’s individual effort. Whether this environment is beneficial to you, you’ll have to figure that out your self. On the same topic, USC actually had a better % passing rate overall for first timers than UC (71.05%>68.42%) on the same exam that the UC top-notchers took (CIT got 78.08% btw). Granted, I think this is an insignificant difference.

Secondly, this is what I’ve heard from my friend studying in CIT-U, and my classmates; that USC has a different focus compared to CIT-U and possibly UC? (I don’t have friends from UC). Apparently, USC focuses more on automotive, where in higher years we have go-cart related projects. On the other hand, CIT-U focuses more on computational and mechatronics. Furthermore, USC grads tend to become managers? (can't confirm)

Thirdly, if you care about accreditations, USC’s BSME is the only University in Vis-Min that is a CHED Center of Excellence. Most importantly, it is a signatory of the Washington Accord, which promises a streamlined process when working abroad.

Finally, and most crucially for me, is that USC is a university, which means that there are other programs other than BSME. That is obvious; however, what is usually looked over is the quality of professors across General Electives and Engineering-related courses. We have physicists handling Engineering Physics, PhDs handling UTS and ETHICS, Economists handling TCW, and much more. It may not matter to you, but for me it did. BSME is a four year journey, as much as I want to graduate and become a Mechanical Engineer, I also want to become an Engineer that is well-rounded. What may actually keep you sane are the minor subjects (or make you insane). Plus, you get to mingle with other students from different programs that are at the top of their own games. I have done personal projects with students from the Physics, Computer Science, Computer Engineering Departments. You can do this in other unis but USC has a much more ‘extroverted’ environment. A lot of students are welcoming, and this is noticeable in how amicable everyone generally is. Whether you care about this, it’s completely up to you. After all,—4 years is a blink in our lifespan but 4 years full of memories, nonetheless. ","Hello. I am Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate going into 2nd year.

Also, are the professors okay and are there many opportunities for different competitions and/or organizations within and outside the department?

For the 2nd year, the polsci secretary told me there would be an MUN under the subject comparative politics. Has anyone here experienced it and if so, what was it like? Was it similar to other MUNs? How were you graded? (Asking as someone who has never experienced a MUN but really really wants to)

On the way to 3rd year, I heard there was a test to take whether you’re fit for either LPS or IRFS. Is it written or practical? Can you choose between the two or are you assigned to only one?

And lastly, what is the OJT or work needed to do as a 4th year student? As LPS can we work at law firms and as IRFS can we work at embassies?

Could someone possibly drop the price for the shuttle buses and the school ID an enlighten me with the other expenses in the school, so that my parents could prepare the said amount.

**Background:**

I took the CAE two Saturdays ago and the results were discussed by the department chair during my interview just last week. I was told I ranked ""superior"" in the abstract reasoning and the STEM college readiness test, while only getting ""above average"" on the rest.

Coupled with the awards I received during SHS, the department chair recommended me the scholarship for ChE (which, based on their website, there exists [two types of grants](https://usc.edu.ph/academics/scholarships)), and that because I (my family) was, by technicality, categorized as ""low income"", I have a chance in obtaining a full-ride scholarship in USC-TC.

Anyway, my concern is that they did not state the minimum grade I need to maintain to avail the scholarship, nor does the website any have mentions of it. I am worried that it would be hard or tedious to maintain the minimum grade.

I also went to the department office earlier to inquire more about the scholarship, but they did not mention a definitive minimum grade. I have already compiled the requirements needed though.

Hi everyone! I’m planning to take the BS Accountancy entrance exam at University of San Carlos – Cebu, but I came from the STEM strand, not ABM. I know it’s an unconventional path to take, but yeah — I’ve grown more interested in the business/accounting field recently and maybe proceed to law as I’ve heard it is also a great pre-law course recently. **I really want to give this a shot.**

Since I don’t have any formal background in accounting or business subjects, I’d love to hear from others who were in the same situation.

I’d really appreciate it if anyone here could share:

* **What topics came out in the entrance test? What topics did the exam focus on? Was it heavy on accounting/business math (like ABM), or was it mostly general math, English, and IQ-type questions?**
* **How much ABM-related content did you encounter since you were from STEM?**
* **Do you have any recommended reviewers—PDFs, books, free resources, or YouTube channels?**
* **Are there specific math or accounting concepts I should review as a non-ABM student?**
* **Was the test more on computations or theory?**

Hi everyone! I’m planning to take the BS Accountancy entrance exam at University of San Carlos – Cebu, but I came from the STEM strand, not ABM. I know it’s an unconventional path to take, but yeah — I’ve grown more interested in the business/accounting field recently and maybe proceed to law as I’ve heard it is also a great pre-law course recently. **I really want to give this a shot.**

Since I don’t have any formal background in accounting or business subjects, I’d love to hear from others who were in the same situation.

I’d really appreciate it if anyone here could share:

* **What topics came out in the entrance test? What topics did the exam focus on? Was it heavy on accounting/business math (like ABM), or was it mostly general math, English, and IQ-type questions?**
* **How much ABM-related content did you encounter since you were from STEM?**
* **Do you have any recommended reviewers—PDFs, books, free resources, or YouTube channels?**
* **Are there specific math or accounting concepts I should review as a non-ABM student?**
* **Was the test more on computations or theory?**
* **Any tips on how to prepare or what to focus on?**
* **What’s the time limit like, and any time‑management tips?**
* **What should I expect on test day?**

If you’ve gone through the same thing or know someone who did, please drop any advice. **And if anyone is also willing to share reviewers or notes, I’d really appreciate it! I'm gonna take it this week or next week, so any help would do. Thank you!**

A month ago, the dept chair called me abt me passing the cae, i took that opportunity to ask abt scholarship opportunies in usc. He said that there were a lot, he even cited a specific one that relates to me(daughter of an ofw) that i can apply for, and that I could visit his office to ask.

However, after i enrolled, I just went straight to the scholarship office(cuz i was too shy to ask the dept chair lmao). The only scholarship they told me abt was the dost, ched, and merit. They refused to tell me abt the other scholarship options after i told them that my family’s income exceeded 300k(it wasn’t even a correct estimate cuz i didn’t know my dad’s exact salary).

Now, i’m planning to apply na sa merit scholarship, but nasayangan jud ko since the merit scholarship is only for one year, and idk what other scholarships i can apply to in my 2nd year😭

Should I go through with it or try inquiring abt the other scholarships again? (Maybe even ask the dept chair this time)😭","HELP ADVICE PLS!

Once you live here in Cebu in order to pursue your studies you should know how to commute or what to ride such as jeepney routes that would pass by USC Talamban (if i'm not mistaken sincr you're taking marine biology?) or you could probably use grab (but its expensive if you use it in day to day basis). You should also observe what's the best time to travel from your condo/apartment to school (since its traffic) like maybe allocate a 1hr time in travelling because traffic is very bad here in cebu lol. That's just my tip since traffic is mainly my problem especially if your house and school is far,i'm not in college yet but i'm an upcoming gr 12 student.

It’s rare to see a uni here in cebu offer marine biology as a program. You can probably ask the bio department for their prospectus (list of subjects for the entire curriculum). If you’re interested in pursuing further studies such as a masters, etc, it’s definitely possible especially if you perform well academically. As for the subjects, there will be a lot of subjects you have to take that are not really related to your program but every college student in the philippines has to go through, like communication, arts, PE, etc. It often gets hectic during the semester because of the busy schedule and workload especially since usc tends to put a lot of subjects per semester. By the 4th year you will accomplish your undergraduate thesis, usually with a group of other people. Early morning classes can also go as early as 7:30 am. Usc is a catholic school as well so there will be required subjects on religion and philosophy. You can join orgs since there is a lot, and you can make friends there as well. Extracurriculars can make your campus life quite fun

Campus - it’s the biggest campus in cebu and is really quite nice. There is a big library, stadium, etc. and it’s on a mountainside so a lot of nature and a lot of hiking. It can get quite hot especially in the uniform. However as the other comments said there will definitely be traffic so plan where you stay accordingly. There are many places to eat both inside and outside and the jeepneys that pass go to some malls where you can go to buy stuff.","Curriculum - Im not entirely familiar with it but I hear it’s good.

Hi ! I can’t give recommendations regarding USJR BSA being better but I can say that your initial course placement in USC does not matter. The only actual aspect would be a sort of separation from your peers where BSMA/BSIA may be looked down on but from my experience this is very rare and it does not matter at all since all major subjects for the first 2 years of all Accounting courses in USC are the same and all students under accounting courses get blocked together after the 1st sem.

You can shift after 1st sem but it isn’t suggested as there is no point to it, the shifting of courses usually happen during PART 1 after your second year. To qualify for BSA you must have all major subjects above 2.0 cut off (you may take repeat classes if you don’t pass cut-off) and pass PART 1.

Don’t feel too bad about not initially qualifying for BSA as there are so many factors in actually passing the course and the entrance exam is not really one of those factors (the department just feels like separating the students 😭). Hope this helps !","Hi ! Someone else had the same concern as you on here and this was my reply in case it helps you sad

I can’t give recommendations regarding USJR BSA being better but I can say that your initial course placement in USC does not matter. The only actual aspect would be a sort of separation from your peers where BSMA/BSIA may be looked down on but from my experience this is very rare and it does not matter at all since all major subjects for the first 2 years of all Accounting courses in USC are the same and all students under accounting courses get blocked together after the 1st sem.

You can shift after 1st sem but it isn’t suggested as there is no point to it, the shifting of courses usually happen during PART 1 after your second year. To qualify for BSA you must have all major subjects above 2.0 cut off (you may take repeat classes if you don’t pass cut-off) and pass PART 1.

Don’t feel too bad about not initially qualifying for BSA as there are so many factors in actually passing the course and the entrance exam is not really one of those factors (the department just feels like separating the students 😭). Hope this helps !","Hi ! I can’t give recommendations regarding USJR BSA being better but I can say that your initial course placement in USC does not matter.

Between the two, we know that the chairwoman of CIT-U is is above par compared to that of USC. Since CIT-U's chairperson is an ""isko"" through and through.

RESEARCH:  
No USC's Computer Science department is not research oriented, the faculty do not have an original research of their own, most of our faculty's names are published in conference proceedings because they act as our advisers, we call them ""GRAMMAR BOTS"", because their major contributions to our paper are just spelling checks, grammar checks, and punctuation marks. We are forced to put their names because we fear their retaliation, the same thing as what they did to our seniors (wala sila gipagraduate due to some thesis related issues). There are rumors that our advisers receives financial incentives for every publication with their names on it, when in fact they are just piggybacking with our thesis topics.

(Our department requires us to present our papers in a conference and have it publish in a conference proceedings, we do the research, we pay the conference fees while our advisers gets the incentives, which is very unfair).

ADVICE:  
If you want a school that is brag worthy then I highly suggest you go to UP Cebu. The UP System has the prestige, recognition, and perceived academic clout. If I had the chance, I could've took UPCAT and enrolled in UP's CS.  
  
If you want employability then you go to UC (https://www.sunstar.com.ph/cebu/local-news/cebus-uc-grads-among-countrys-most-preferred), their main focus is on industry transferable skills. They make sure that their students are employable and work ready.

CIT-U CS is beefing up their curriculum, simply because the CIT-U CS Chairwoman is bringing in the ""UP"" culture into CIT-U.

But if you want to go for USC, go ahead no one is stopping you. But I suggest you take CpE instead, their facility is way better than CS, and their faculty dynamics is less toxic too.

I also suggest that you also check the faculty profile, specially where they got their PhD's from. You can tell how smart the faculty are based on their academic qualifications, the baseline should be a PhD degree in the UP System, much better if they had their PhD in a QS or THE top 100 ranked university.","LEADERSHIP:

I don't know if they are going to change it, pero it was basically your regular college entrance exam. If you did well in your undergrad, I think the grad entrance exam becomes a ""formality"" somewhat. Not sure anymore on the order, pero I remember taking 5 tests.

1. IQ/Logic 
2. Math (Algebra, Geometry, Arithmetic)
3. English (Spelling, Grammar, Reading Comprehension)
4.  Science (this is for some programs only. I took the exam with other takers and they did not have this part)
5. Essay (Very specific on the program you applied. This one took the longest.)

All of them have time-limits, with the essay taking the longest. The English exam was the longest. IIRC, the exam started at 7 AM and ended at 12 noon.

The ""hardest"" was probably the English exam, mostly because of the length, but also because you have to have near mastery of the English language to score high. 

The essay tests your theoretical knowledge in the program you're applying for, and also if you're updated on the current trends in research and industry. You're given 5 prompts, and you are to write an essay regarding one of the said prompts. 

As I said, if you've done well in your undergrad, you probably won't be doing bad on this exam. IDK how much weight the results of those exams would have on your admission to the program since different departments are run by different chairpersons with differing priorities. In my case, the exam results were a ""formality,"" what mattered most was the interview with the chairperson which comes afterward. 

My interview experience was quite casual. The chairperson asked me about my undergrad experience, motivation to get a higher degree, goals during and after graduation, and—most importantly—my research plans. 

I emphasize the research plans because a CHED memo took effect a year or so ago which mandated that grad students must have been published in a peer-reviewed journal/publication before they can apply for thesis/dissertation defense. This means that you can't graduate if you are not published.

Two weeks back, USC had an online orientation which stated that the publication requirement for the grad students must be with a peer-reviewed AND indexed journal. I won't get into the technical details on journal indexing, but this means that the students' publications must be of a higher quality. This is because most journals and publications are peer-reviewed, but not all are indexed. Typically, the journals that are indexed have more stringent review processes (thus somewhat low acceptance rate) and/or have quite expensive publication fees (typically ranging from PhP 25,000 to PhP 200,000).

So yeah, I suggest not to worry about the exam that much. Instead, focus more on what research you want to do as a grad student. Try to find what recent publications and projects the faculty of the program you're applying to have done or are doing, and communicate with them if possible. The interview with the chairperson could also be your introduction to the research done by yhe department/program.

In any case, see you around the campus!","I took mine almost a year ago now. I don't know if they are going to change it, pero it was basically your regular college entrance exam.

I will be sharing my experience during my undergrad pharmacy student days at USC. One might argue that USC is one of the best Pharmacy school in this country and Pharmacy itself is a difficult program as it is a pre-med course. Similar to other pre-med courses, daghan units per semester. The curriculum that was implemented during my time of study had like 26-30 units per semester so every week the motivation was just surviving to reach the next week by chasing deadlines, doing all-nighters to study, drawing leaves for botany class (?), and being stressed and overwhelmed all at once. It was a very vicious cycle. Me and my batchmates were all on survival mode until each semester ends. The amount of information you need to absorb at a short amount of time plus the projects and assignments with deadlines fast approaching is enough to make anyone breakdown and be burned out (normal rani). All I can say is it is not for the faint of heart hilak mga 1 minute then tuon balik was like a norm.  
  
Hopefully following the new Trimester period alleviated the problems we were facing so that there is more breathing room and less cramped up schedules. For context schedules before were arranged like 7am to 5pm straight classes for the entire week lain panang half day saturday classes. Then mag dunggan na mga deadline sa projects with exams and quizzes.

During your first year, set your expectations right. This is the time you are adjusting to your new environment.

I will be sharing my experience during my undergrad pharmacy student days at USC. One might argue that USC is one of the best Pharmacy school in this country and Pharmacy itself is a difficult program as it is a pre-med course. Similar to other pre-med courses, daghan units per semester. The curriculum that was implemented during my time of study had like 26-30 units per semester so every week the motivation was just surviving to reach the next week by chasing deadlines, doing all-nighters to study, drawing leaves for botany class (?), and being stressed and overwhelmed all at once. It was a very vicious cycle. Me and my batchmates were all on survival mode until each semester ends. The amount of information you need to absorb at a short amount of time plus the projects and assignments with deadlines fast approaching is enough to make anyone breakdown and be burned out (normal rani). All I can say is it is not for the faint of heart hilak mga 1 minute then tuon balik was like a norm.  
  
Hopefully following the new Trimester period alleviated the problems we were facing so that there is more breathing room and less cramped up schedules. For context schedules before were arranged like 7am to 5pm straight classes for the entire week lain panang half day saturday classes. Then mag dunggan na mga deadline sa projects with exams and quizzes.

During your first year, set your expectations right. This is the time you are adjusting to your new environment. Struggle ni for most students during this phase, but I think lenient ang faculty during this time but don't be complacent. If you are aiming for honors this is the best time mag pundo kag grades kay tbh after 1st year it is all downhill HAHA.

CS student here from DCISM, directly affected by the controversy.

IT at USC falls under the same department as CS, so if nothing changes, IT and IS students will continue to face the same treatment. Actually, they already have, just without as much public attention. There has always been an unspoken bias in the dept for favoring CS, but if even CS students are now being treated unfairly, what does that say about how IT and IS students are handled? Many IT and IS students already feel neglected, receiving far less support from the department. Even the faculty can testify so.  
  
As for the 3-year course, as efficient as a compressed curriculum might seem, the biggest concerns are heavier workloads each term, less time for in-depth learning, and greater difficulty balancing academics with internship opportunities. This is something that students in the new curriculum are already worried about for the upcoming semester.  
  
If you're considering IT, my IT friends strongly recommend looking into other schools like CIT, which offer better facilities and support. Whether pursuing IT at USC is a smart choice depends on how willing you are to navigate the challenges and roadblocks the school may present, sometimes unfairly. So with that, I hope you do take the time to consider your options. Good luck OP!","Hi OP! CS student here from DCISM, directly affected by the controversy.

I'm one of the students affected by the graduation issue under USC's CS program, and I totally understand your concern. I commend you for asking these questions before committing to USC.

USC does have its strengths, such as a good environment for networking and extracurriculars. While I can no longer trust the USC administration, I genuinely believe in the tenacity and spirit of its students. There are active student organizations to engage with and opportunities to connect with local tech groups. USC also has partnerships with companies in the industry, which can be helpful for internships and job opportunities.

As for the program, it's struggling right now. The new curriculum is crammed into 3 years, making it extremely fast-paced, leaving little room for failure, and making it difficult to balance academics, research, and internships. There are faculty shortages, limited classrooms, and administrative decisions that have put students in tough situations. You'll find that most students rely on self-study and external resources rather than what is covered in class.

It's difficult to say if things will get better or not in the near future. The current structure on the administrative end isn’t expected to change anytime soon, so there's no guarantee that things will improve quickly. If you do enroll, be prepared for these challenges and be proactive in handling potential setbacks. And while there’s still time before the next academic year starts, it wouldn’t hurt to explore other schools and their CS programs as well. But if you do choose USC, be ready to navigate the difficulties and commit to a lot of self-learning at a fast pace.

Room for 1 is usually expensive since you're basically smacked right at the center of the city. If you go a bit farther, there are other options too although nearer to other schools and not USC (such as in Urgello near Southwestern University) or you could opt even farther that should save you up more (like in Guadalupe) but consider the traffic since it's also bad here so you might as well get a place to rent near USC or some minutes of reasonable walking.

Many of my friends in undergrad and Law and Masters rented. It just depends on your budget from cheap bedspacers to expensive condo units. And see how much distance you're amenable too.

Tip, there's lots of Cebu rent groups. I've joined some. I ended up not finding one from there, but it did help me get a benchmark of how much the prices are for what it's set up to be and how maintained it is.

However and sadly, you have to be strategic about your friends. Know the friends who you can party with but limit who you can trust because USC Law’s environment can get competitive and toxic.

You need a circle who will be there for you when things are not going well (bad recits, bad exams, personal problems), the kind of circle who will not judge you, understand where you’re coming from, and not talk about what you shared to them.

But I think if your friends are mostly working students, they do not have the time to indulge in petty situations. For fresh graduates though, they have this tendency to dwell on rankings kasi it kinda is the thing they’re used to.","This is a tricky question, hahahaha!

It is true that the BS Pharmacy is already quite challenging especially if you choose to study in USC because it is a top performing school for Pharmacy. During my freshmen years we were about 120+ in my batch fast forward to graduation day only 40 of us in my original batch graduated together. The rest either shifted, transferred or had to graduate the next following year.

Like any other premed courses, there are a lot of units around 26 to 30 units per semester so expect most of your days either studying, complying with your academic workload, or being overwhelmed (this is normal). An advantage to studying Pharmacy in USC is that it has facilities, connections, accreditations, and prestige.

* Facilities wise, the labs are complete and I heard there are new equipment that recently arrived, there is also an animal house for doing drug studies on rats and mice.
* Connections, USC Department of Pharmacy have many international university partners, you may get the chance to visit these foreign universities if granted the opportunity. Although this is quite competitive because there are limited slots for student selection. Aside from this, the internship experience during your 4th year is also topnotch where you get to work at big industry partners (hospital, manufacturing, etc.) and learn from the best.
* Accreditations, the Pharmacy department is a FAAP PAASCU Level III accredited program which is the highest accreditation for any pharmacy program offered in the country. I think they are also vying to become a center for development.
* Prestige, there is perceived excellence when you graduate from USC BS Pharmacy which translates to respect, and better job opportunities.

Well that's pretty much the pros about it now unto the cons. Less time for yourself, family, and friends. When you take this course in USC, you are going to be very busy with managing your academic workload. I had missed a lot of family gatherings, birthdays, celebrations, and etc. due to being occupied with acads. It is quite a bummer really but that's to be expected given the amount of units per semester which is the same for any premed courses. The building is really far from the portal, if you are running late and there is no shuttle or you don't drive a vehicle, you have to run uphill.

As for the question if lisod, tbh lisod jud. Wala mn siguro course nga dili lisod just need to muster the right amount of time, effort, and motivation to finish the course. Hope this helps.","Hello carolinian pharmacist here.

TLDR; 4th year students can't graduate for another year because THESIS II is not being offered despite having three professors that have the credentials are willing to teach it.

A comment in #CarolinianFreedomWall11134 should tell you that USC Computer Science is nothing special:  
""If your goal is to get your child an education the subjects taught in UC, CIT, USJR and UV are just the same as the ones taught in USC. Nothing special being taught here to increase your child's employability or net worth.""

Furthermore, a comment in #CarolinianFreedomWall11352 highlights how research is being handled by the faculty of DCISM in general:  
""A notable difference I have observed is the level of faculty involvement in refining research methodologies. In our department, it often seems that the adviser's role is limited to correcting grammar and spotting typos, rather than actively scrutinizing and strengthening the methodology.""

And, it's **not** **just** about research.

Despite these, it's not all doom and gloom; however, the issue mentioned above is real. Ask yourself, are all the good things in USC Computer Science worth it when abject disregard of the students is a certain for all who dare to take the program.

UP-Cebu and CIT-U are great options—you can't go wrong with them. If you really want to study in USC for the environment and you like programming, you can still take Computer Engineering. If you are into AI or Datascience, Physics is a must for the analytical skills you'll learn through Analysis I, II, and III. Additionally, they have a course on AI and do Data Science stuff as their projects/research.","Hello! If you're not aware, there's a big issue regarding how the department is being handled.

I’m not sure how it compares to other college exams as I only took USC’s entrance exam. The entrance exam is comprised of general subjects and a set of subjects depending on the course you are applying to so either STEM, HUMSS, or ABM, so if you’re applying to ABM you would have entrep, accountancy, etc. sections but if you were STEM you would have bio, earth sci, etc. in addition to the general subjects.

The general subjects (or the subj that everyone takes no matter your course) are

1. IQ - I found it okay and I don’t think it is necessarily something to study for but please note that as from what I’ve HEARD (not confirmed), the IQ score is heavily used to determine if you will be accepted into your chosen course or referred to another related course, so if you applied for Accountancy you might be referred to Management Accounting or if you applied to Comsci you might be referred to IT. There are interviews as well but its been talked about that the IQ is relevant to the referral to other courses.

2. Math - heavy on fractions !! Some topics that are included but only had 1-3 questions each were factoring trinomials, adding and subtracting square roots with whole numbers, measurements such as yards, gallons, and pints, area of squares and triangles

3. Earth Science - a blur but had basic tectonic plates gamay

4. English - I dont recall much

5. Psych/Philo (not sure) - Mentioned names such as Erik Erikson

6. Lit - I dont recall much

If ur planning on taking up psych in usc you should apply now since they run out of slots pretty fast. A lot of my friends last year had to settle for different courses since psych was full.

If youll take up psych you’ll be in the Talamban Campus which is very bukid. You wont feel any pollution in campus. Youll also be in a very good location if you decide to live near campus, youll be near hospitals, malls, grocery stores and anything else you’ll need. Traffic is bad but i dont think its any worse than most cities in the Philippines since traffic is always moving and its not like theres traffic the entire day. 

My older sister is in laguna right now for college and when she comes home over the holidays she always complains about how much hotter it is here compared to laguna. And this is during ber months OP, ha so its already relatively cold. Pero the rooms in usc are airconed so i dont think its that big of a deal unless you plan on going out and walking midday.

What you should be concerned about is the FLOOD. When it rains supper hard nonstop for a few days it starts flooding everywhere. The entire area where ur campus is located turns into a river lol. Pero this only during bagyo season. 

Cebu is very nice OP, we have bukid and dagat. And our metro areas arent too polluted. The people are kind and helpful.

My older sister is in laguna right now for college and when she comes home over the holidays she always complains about how much hotter it is here compared to laguna. And this is during ber months OP, ha so its already relatively cold. Pero the rooms in usc are airconed so i dont think its that big of a deal unless you plan on going out and walking midday.

What you should be concerned about is the FLOOD. When it rains supper hard nonstop for a few days it starts flooding everywhere. The entire area where ur campus is located turns into a river lol. Pero this only during bagyo season. 

Cebu is very nice OP, we have bukid and dagat. And our metro areas arent too polluted. The people are kind and helpful. Dont worry if you cant speak bisaya the locals would speak in tagalog for you, most of the time.",matched_comment,comment,mdsr7xy,t3_1ity0fi,False

Since your young kiddo, and u came from the Big City, the traffic here will be just a minor for u.. comparing it in Luzon, it's just a piece of cake 4u.. 

But if you don't know how to commute by yourself then u have a problem 😜 

Galing din ako Ng manila before, born and raised in Q.C, but we transferred here and I stud and graduated in USC-MAIN. 

Maganda na Ang USC Talamban campus (t.c) ngayun, maraming course na transfer sa T.C na galing sa main, Ang naiwan nlng ata sa main is COMMERCE BSA, M.A Business Ad, and LAW and pang graduate courses, I think ! ..

Based on my experience and observation from my time and to this present is very different talaga, I'm glad graduate nako and all those fun was now in my memories to keep.. (those were the days) 😎

What I can advise to u kiddo is just enjoy the ride of being young! you have all the freedom to explore, just enjoy being a student, try new things, get wild and be yourself, the world is in your hand .. hehe

For the Internet, kahit San Naman okay, as long naka landline then buy TP link Mesh for strong WIFI... 

👉PLDT or Globe or CONVERGE is what I recommend for fast internet Lan cable,

👉Best coverage Globe And SMART in Cebu

💥 Eto Yung pros and cons ko for your reference:

Cons: 

1. Small roads in the main city. (very few shortcut roads)
2. Sometime its traffic during Monday and Friday rush hour, holiday Events, road accident, construction, etc...
3. Some famous fast food and other fine dining are just found in Luzon not in Cebu. 

Pros: 
1. Many good foods to explore in Cebu
2. Learn the bisaya language so u won't be ignorant 
3. Gusto mong gumimik (Malls, Disco bars, coffee shops, Hotel, motel, etc...)
4. Beach Resorts are near in Mactan Lapu-Lapu 45min to 1/2hrs travel if ur living from Cebu city, then 2 to 4 hrs going to north or south of cebu, depends on ur destination ..
5. Road trip north and South of Cebu..
6. Inter-Island nearest destination (CAMOTES, BOHOL, DUMAGUETE, Bantayan Island, Siquijor, BACOLOD, 
7. Grab Car, Grab Foods, food panda,
8. Move it motorcycle Taxi
9. Maxim delivery 
10. Hotel Buffet 
11. Tops Mountain view plus city view and Sea View  (sometime its zero visibility bcoz of foggy clouds
12. Travel to western Cebu to TCH going to Balamban, Toledo, if you like to explore the Mountain areas of Cebu, 

I'll leave the rest for you to explore.. 🤙

How? You can get them by joining co-curricular orgs, or some extra-curricular orgs offer CES activities.

There are two different types of CES points that you must get: Department-wide CES points and university-wide CES points.

Department-wide CES are basically CES points within the department. For example, if your program is Computer Engineering, you need to volunteer as a tutor or help around the department to get your CES hours up.

In my department (BA COMM-MED), they initiate and offer volunteer positions in podcasts, radio stations, and other CES initiatives within the department.

However, in case you plan to shift, department-wide CES points are non-transferable, meaning you start from zero once you are enrolled to a new program.

University-wide CES points are the activities initiated by USC that is open to all Carolinians.

Fun runs for a cause, donation drives, clean-ups, and the like are just some of the stuff they offer.

[This organization](https://www.facebook.com/share/p/14zCeAGDpa/) is currently offering a CES activity that anyone can join up. According to the org's president, a donation of up to PHP500 could get you 5 CES points (PHP100  = 1 CES point). Additionally, helping in the community visit will guarantee you up to 9 CES points. 

For your CES points to be properly credited to you, filling out the required reflection forms properly are needed.

To track your points, you can ask your department council's CES representative to be updated on how many CES points you've gathered over the course of the school year. 

If you're within SAS, you need a total of 25 department-initated CES points, and 10 university-initiated CES points.

Based from what I've checked with SoE, you need a total of 60 CES points. 70% of those must come from department-initated CES activities, with 30% just covering university-initiated activities.

**PLEASE ASK YOUR CES REPRESENTATIVE FOR VALID INFORMATION!!!!**

No, OP. I think this means that enrollment has ended for the 2nd Semester of A.Y. 2024-2025 for continuing/transfer students of USC. 

Dont worry! In your case, you have to wait for the opening of enrollment for A.Y. 2025-2026 for upcoming College students(Freshmen like yourself). Keep a heads up for the announcements and dont sweat it because USC enrollment for the Freshies will last up to the official start of the A.Y. which will be around August, 2025.


P.S. Dont forget to also refer to the enrollment guide once you're there na.",">January enrollment period has already endedna—does this mean I can no longer enroll?

Meaning imo nanang trabaho to expound your learning da topics thru research. Sila ilang role mura rnag tighimog grado and mutudlo na sila ang basic ra kau then ang mugawas sa exam mga complex na problems and questions jd na. By guidelines wa silay giviolate kay approved by CHED nmn na. USC is not into the traditional ways of teaching na spoonfed na, RBE og OBE approach nana sila.

Tanong lang po sana—may ma-recommend ba kayo na effective na body oil o haplas para sa muscle pain?

Lately, madalas na sumasakit yung likod, balikat, at minsan pati legs ko—signs na tumatanda na talaga siguro 😅. Si misis naman, buntis, and madalas din sumakit yung lower back at katawan niya. Kaya naghahanap kami ng **pwedeng ipahid na safe for pregnant women**, at effective din sana pang-relax at pantanggal ng lamig o pananakit.

Currently ginagamit ko ay wintergreen + efficascent oil na extra strength then my late mother when she was still alive, mayroon syang dried mangosteen peels na sinasama namin sa efficascent oil. I am wondering if baka mayroon kayung B4L na liniment oil or personal liniment concoction.

Every year, news sites like ABS-CBN, GMA, or Rappler post about the Philippine independence from the United States. Often, in the comments you see a lot of people claiming that the Philippines should have stayed a part of the United States; often citing the corrupt governance or citing the United States' status as a first world country and our own status as a third world country as reasons for why we should've remained a *state*. However, I think a **lot** of these people are greatly uninformed or misinformed. It's frustrating to read. Not just on the 4th of July, but anytime the Philippines is spoken in the same breath as the United States. In my opinion, there are many reasons why the Philippines would **not** have been better off under the United States' occupation.

The reason behind my opinion are as follows:

**1. Statehood**

A reoccurring comment about the US occupation of the Philippines is how *state na sana tayo ngayon.* This is largely false. Yes, Hawaii and Alaska were inducted into the United States in 1959, 13 years after our independence. However, there are some facts present that show why the Philippines would not have been inducted into statehood. For example, during the bombing at Pearl Harbor, Manila was expressly mentioned in former US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's ""Day of Infamy"" speech. However, it is later crossed out, leaving only a mention of Hawaii.

Another fact that points against the Philippines' statehood is how outlying territories (ones that are not close to the continental United States) were never considered into statehood. These territories include Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and Guam. Even if we stayed a territory of the United States, we would never get statehood. Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. in recent years have been considered for statehood, but it never passes because of how a 51st state will drastically affect the electoral college.

Although, the Philippines can be a territory but it comes with its own issues.

**2. Inability to vote in national elections**

U.S. Territories cannot vote for the national election, meaning, they have no say in who's the President and who represents them in Congress. Although there are some territories with representation in Congress, however, they cannot vote on any bills. This is bad because territories often heavily rely on Federal aid from the Government. Any cut on Federal funding, like we've seen recently under the Trump administration, can heavily cripple the economy of these territories. What's worse, they have no say in those cuts.

**3. The Jones Act**

The Jones Act is a federal law that restricts foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between the US and other territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam. This makes shipping of goods **very** expensive. Often doubling the price of goods once they arrive in the territory and raising the cost of living to more than the main land United States. The Philippines being an archipelago far detached from the mainland US would make it susceptible to the insane price gauging that results from the Jones act.

**4. The Compact of Free Association**

The Compact of Free Association or ""COFA"" is a special relationship between the United States and three pacific island nations - The Federated States of Micronesia, The Marshall Islands, and Palau. This allows citizens of these three nations free entry into the United States. If the Philippines were a territory of the United States, COFA migrants would be allowed free entry into the country. This isn't a big issue in itself. However, in Guam for example, there is an overrepresentation of COFA migrants in prison. There is also a sizeable number of homeless COFA migrants on Guam. So, if the Philippines were a territory, that means we'd have people who can freely enter the country, which may double our already bloated prison system and our already overpopulated squatters areas.

But it's the United States, right? Poverty will be the thing of the past! We're a first world country! There's no corruption!

**5. Homelessness and Poverty**

There has been a rise in a steady rise in homelessness in the US. And as the cost of living rises and the minimum wage stays the same, more and more people have reported being below the poverty line. This is a well-documented struggle in the States that often gets overlooked.

**6. Corruption**

Corruption in the United States is difficult to discuss without explaining the Federal System. If you were active online during the 2016 Philippine Election, you would no doubt remember that Former President Rodrigo Duterte wanted to change the Philippine's system into a Federalist one. Although, leaked versions of their new constitution in 2020 showed that his version of ""Federalism"" did not aim to divide the country into a National Federal and State government, but rather simply as a ploy to extend term limits.

In the United States there are two seperate but co-equal bodies of government. The Federal and State government. The Federal Government is nationwide, and the State Governments are for each of the 50 states. If the Philippines were a territory, we'd be under both the US national government and our own territorial government led by a Governor. Because of this divide and certain parts of the United States Constitution that grants powers and protections to the State Government, there are some laws that only the State can make and some laws that the Federal government has supreme power to control.

This means, on top of the national Federal tax, the State government of the Philippines can issue its own state taxes. The Philippine State government also has control on how education is handled in the country. So, our current issues with absurd taxation and the education crisis will continue to persist even if we were a US territory. Even the issue of political dynasties will not only persist, but worsen as now we would only be held by our state congress and a governor. With how families control a single province in the Philippines now, there is no stopping a single family from practically ruling the Philippines if it were a territory.

In fact, oligarchies like the Villars will continue to exist in a US driven Philippines especially with favorable to big businesses most US laws are. We see that with billionaires barely paying taxes that matches their net worth. Again, use our neighbor Guam as an example where families like the Leon Guerrero, Calvo, and Camacho practically run the island, both being in government and in big businesses.

And often, those in Washington do not provide major oversight to its territories. We will be left alone to our own devises under the rule of one family.

But what if somehow we were a state. Just what if? Then couldn't we be better off?

**7. The Electoral College**

Barring everything I said about Federalism and how it can be used by oligarchs, an issue the United States as a country face is its lack of direct democracy. In every election, the people do not actually vote for their president. Instead, the people vote for electors who promise to support that candidate. Each state gets a certain number of electoral votes based on population. To win the presidency for example, the candidate must get at least 270 electoral votes. Electors are not politicians or government officials, in the most honest sense, they are just *guys.* Remember in 2016 when two rival political parties won the presidency and vice presidency with Duterte and Leni? In a US system, you vote for a tandem. If the president wins, their vice president wins by default.

There are plenty of other issues with the United States as a whole and being a territory that does not make it enticing for the Philippines to be a territory.

This doesn't even go deeper into things such as the Philippines becoming a close target for North Korea if it ever wanted to attack the United States, or how the United States only has two parties, the Democrats and Republicans, and they have been in a state of absolute deadlock in Congress for decades so no progressive bill ever gets passed, or how lawmakers and judges have stocks in private prisons which incentivizes them to support laws that will put more people into those prisons, or how slavery is technically legal if you're an inmate, or how medical insurance is not universal and there are doctors in hospitals are not covered by your insurance despite the hospital being covered, or just entire can of worms that is national student loan debt.

I'm not a hater of the United States. This is just reality, and the reality is that a lot of Filipinos who sing its praises are misinformed or uninformed. **And this isn't about immigration or being an OFW, that's its own thing. This is VERY SPECIFICALLY the Philippines as a state or territory of the United States.**","The Philippines being under the United States would not make the country more successful On July 4 1946, the United States proclaimed the Philippines' independence, ending its 48-year colonization of our country.

One job was often enough. Land, housing, education... all within reach. But the systems they upheld (rigid education, oil imports, cartelized agriculture, Marcos-style cronyism) set the stage for what we now inherit: systemic fragility. And now that fragility's on us to fix.

Let’s start with education. Boomers were raised to memorize, obey, and repeat. Loyalty to the company, the church, the state. GE was nationalistic, but shallow. You went to school, you passed the test, you worked 30 years, you retired. Done. But that doesn’t work anymore. I’m coming from a place of access. Yes, top-tier private education, scholarships, fast-tracked modules. But even I had to unlearn most of what was taught. The world doesn't reward obedience now. It rewards adaptability. I don't care if you finished UP, Ateneo, La Salle, or a barangay state college. If you can't navigate biotech, AI, or climate realities, you're part of the problem. That’s the new GE we need: not Rizal memos or ASEAN trivia but systems thinking, bio-literacy, food tech, power grid resilience.

On sugar? Let's not kid ourselves. I come from a province that fed off haciendas. Some of my relatives still do. But while they cling to muscovado nostalgia, the rest of the world moved on. HFCS flooded us during WTO liberalization, and instead of pivoting, we cried foul. We could've gone biotech: improved cane varietals, fermentation-based alternatives, export-grade downstream products. But we didn't. Now we import, even the sugar we mix into our own sodas.

Marcos Sr.? That’s complicated. You can't talk energy or industrial policy in this country without someone invoking his name. He built infrastructure, yes. But he also gutted institutions. He raised technocrats, then kneecapped them with cronies. I’m not romanticizing pre-Martial Law governance, pero sa totoo lang: his pivot to nuclear, to central planning, to industrialization... those were necessary moves. What failed was the corruption, the monopolies, the lack of feedback loops. We should’ve kept the industrial base and thrown out the palace greed... not the other way around.

Tech and biotech? That’s where this generation could leap ahead—if we’re allowed. I’ve sunk capital into early-stage bio, semicon, renewables. I’ve seen what small labs in Laguna and Cebu can do. If we stop burying them under customs delays and “import permit” rackets. Back in the 70s, we led Asia in electronics manufacturing. Now? We assemble parts and export brains. We should be editing rice genes for climate resistance, developing drought-tolerant kamote, doing CRISPR on native crops. But no. We’re too busy debating GMOs while the rest of ASEAN eats our lunch.

Energy? That’s another story boomers screwed us on. They enjoyed a world of cheap diesel, low population density, and negligible emissions. We don’t. My electricity bill goes up while Meralco locks us into more coal. Meanwhile, I’ve got friends off-grid on solar with better reliability than what Manila gets. That’s absurd. Our archipelago has wind, hydro, geothermal, and solar. If we had the right grid, the right incentives, the right governance. Instead we import LNG and pray for typhoons not to knock things out. That’s . That’s colonial hangover energy policy & not independence.


Work? Boomers stayed in one job for life. That’s extinct. Everyone I know juggles two, three income streams. Not because we’re greedy but because one isn't enough. But you know what’s worse? Doing three jobs and still falling behind. That’s where the system breaks. We need to stop romanticizing hustle and start demanding systems that work. Automated logistics, fair digital taxation, biotech-enabled agri, public-private tech transfer. The tools are here. The policy is not.

Boomers lived through simpler constraints. We’re surviving complex collapses. They had a blueprint. We have rubble and code. And yet, I’m not hopeless. I’ve seen talent in rural Gen Zs who can code, grow food, analyze proteins. I’ve seen single moms in sugar towns build microbusinesses on 4Ps funds and TikTok.

Nung early 30s na nga ako nag-tresspass na nga sila sa bahay na inuupahan ko and isa-isa na nilang inaangkin mga bagay na pinaghirapan ko kasi ako naman daw panganay (ibigay ko na daw yung PC ko na ginagamit ko for work para sa anak ng kaaptid ko kasi makakabili naman daw ako ng bago, then yung phone ko sa kapatid ko na daw, yung induction cooker sa asawa na daw ng kapatid ko, yung business books na matagal kong pinag-ipunan palitan ko daw ng religious books kasi bible lang daw ang book na kailangan ko, etc.). For the 4th time lumipat ako ng tirahan para makalayo sa kanila. And now this? Magiging legal na gatasan na ako neto. I'm entering my 40s now and alam ko they are still trying to muscle their way into my life kasi they are reaching out to some of the people who knew me (some former and current coworkers, etc).

1ltfohq,Philippines,What is Pinoy Culture?,5,,,1751914769.0,2025-07-07 18:59:29,akiestar,https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1ltfohq/what_is_pinoy_culture/,/r/Philippines/comments/1ltfohq/what_is_pinoy_culture/n1usmey/,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,">*So what is the answer? Is it the spanish culture that was passed down? Can the people in the metro claim the culture of the south or the north?*

Filipino culture is not a monolith. Just because I can't relate to other cultures within the Philippines doesn't mean they're any less ""Filipino culture"".

Look at the discourse around food, for example. Laing is distinctly Bicolano, kinilaw is distinctly Cebuano, inasal is distinctly Negrense and tiyula itum is distinctly Tausug. Yet we all call that ""Filipino cuisine"" alongside sinigang, adobo and lechon and claim it as part of a national idea of what ""Filipino culture"" is.

Just because one part of the Philippines has a distinct culture from another part of the country, it doesn't mean that it is not ""Filipino culture"". Marcos the Elder tried that with imposing a Tagalog-centric ""Filipino culture"" from the language down back in the 1970s. We should not make the same mistake.

>*There are culture ng tribes pero not as a nation. Kasi if you go to Japan, Korea, Indonesia, China and Vietnam. You can see that they somehow preserved their culture even with western occupation.*

These countries also have distinct cultural traditions within their borders, colonialism or no colonialism. They're not monoliths either.

Even then, we need to stop insisting that colonial cultural influences are only a bad thing. It is there, whether we like it or not, and we can't do anything about it. We have to make the most of it, and Filipino culture is on its own beautiful no matter what people say. So what if our culture looks too similar to Latin America or the West? It's still ours, no? (I also find this line ironic. You can't say with a straight face ""the Philippines has nothing in common with Latin America; we are only Asian"" and ""the Philippines has no culture; it's too much like Latin America"" in the same breath. Which one is it then, really?)

Japan, Korea, China and Vietnam are all old societies and they were polities even before there was a Philippines to begin with, so of course they would have had time to consolidate their respective countries into something somewhat more homogeneous. Indonesia, on the other hand, did not. Indonesia is a young country, and is just as diverse as the Philippines is. Can someone from Aceh reasonably claim that Borobudur, built by the Javanese, or the Hindi temples of Bali, or the headhunting tradition of the Dayak, is ""their culture""? Probably not, yet it's still part of this national idea of what ""Indonesian"" culture is. Why can't we do the same in the Philippines?

>*Pero satin, may pumupunta ba na tourist to immerse in our cultural site?*

This is not a cultural problem. This is an infrastructure problem.

I'm from Marinduque. Foreigners go and watch the Moriones Festival every year, and that is a tradition that is distinctly Filipino. I'm sure foreigners go and watch the live cruxifictions at San Pedro Cutud in San Fernando, or get tattoos from Apo Whang-od in Buscalan, or see the balangays of Butuan. The government needs to do a better job of promoting cultural tourism, but the ingredients are there.

Again, Filipino culture is not just what was there before colonization. Colonial culture is Filipino culture too. Post-colonial culture is Filipino culture too. How is a rondalla or the baroque churches of the Philippines any less authentically Filipino than the Kawayan Torogan of the Maranao or the Banaue Rice Terraces? We need to move beyond this longing for something pre-colonial as a mark of authenticity as it doesn't do us any good. We don't get to appreciate Filipino culture for what it is, warts and all, if all we do is just long for something that isn't there and will never be there.",">*So what is the answer?

Just because one part of the Philippines has a distinct culture from another part of the country, it doesn't mean that it is not ""Filipino culture"". Marcos the Elder tried that with imposing a Tagalog-centric ""Filipino culture"" from the language down back in the 1970s. We should not make the same mistake.

>*There are culture ng tribes pero not as a nation. Kasi if you go to Japan, Korea, Indonesia, China and Vietnam. You can see that they somehow preserved their culture even with western occupation.*

These countries also have distinct cultural traditions within their borders, colonialism or no colonialism. They're not monoliths either.

Even then, we need to stop insisting that colonial cultural influences are only a bad thing. It is there, whether we like it or not, and we can't do anything about it. We have to make the most of it, and Filipino culture is on its own beautiful no matter what people say. So what if our culture looks too similar to Latin America or the West? It's still ours, no? (I also find this line ironic. You can't say with a straight face ""the Philippines has nothing in common with Latin America; we are only Asian"" and ""the Philippines has no culture; it's too much like Latin America"" in the same breath. Which one is it then, really?)

Japan, Korea, China and Vietnam are all old societies and they were polities even before there was a Philippines to begin with, so of course they would have had time to consolidate their respective countries into something somewhat more homogeneous. Indonesia, on the other hand, did not. Indonesia is a young country, and is just as diverse as the Philippines is. Can someone from Aceh reasonably claim that Borobudur, built by the Javanese, or the Hindi temples of Bali, or the headhunting tradition of the Dayak, is ""their culture""? Probably not, yet it's still part of this national idea of what ""Indonesian"" culture is. Why can't we do the same in the Philippines?

>*Pero satin, may pumupunta ba na tourist to immerse in our cultural site?*

This is not a cultural problem. This is an infrastructure problem.

I'm from Marinduque. Foreigners go and watch the Moriones Festival every year, and that is a tradition that is distinctly Filipino. I'm sure foreigners go and watch the live cruxifictions at San Pedro Cutud in San Fernando, or get tattoos from Apo Whang-od in Buscalan, or see the balangays of Butuan. The government needs to do a better job of promoting cultural tourism, but the ingredients are there.

Again, Filipino culture is not just what was there before colonization. Colonial culture is Filipino culture too. Post-colonial culture is Filipino culture too. How is a rondalla or the baroque churches of the Philippines any less authentically Filipino than the Kawayan Torogan of the Maranao or the Banaue Rice Terraces? We need to move beyond this longing for something pre-colonial as a mark of authenticity as it doesn't do us any good. We don't get to appreciate Filipino culture for what it is, warts and all, if all we do is just long for something that isn't there and will never be there.",matched_comment,comment,n1usmey,t1_n1t4ar1,False

Lol, so your ship spending 5 hours to get within harpoon range is not a factor?  What's a bigger problem, losing a missile or losing a ship?



Also, your argument would make more sense if the 50 year old harpoon was faster.  In 60 seconds it covers only 14 km,  in the same time the brahmos can travel 58 km.  Isang it started to keep the big, expensive ships and their dozens of trained crew as far away from the enemy as possible?  This isn't early WW2.  Even by late WW2, ships stayed away from their targets, airplanes did the damage.  Now we have missiles and drones.  What good is an old, slow, 40km range antiship missile when the enemy can reach much further? A harpoon is ₱70 million wasted.


>Drones this and drones that. They are very susceptible to Electronic Warfare


Old news, now it's mostly flying by physical connection, autonomous targeting, loitering and hidden munitiond, etc.
Again, a US carrier group was driven away by the poor, tiny group of low-budget DIY houthis with missiles and drones.  If it works against the US, why not China?

Get enough sleep. I can't stress this enough. Puyat is too common for students and even workers, but it's terrible for your brain. As someone with depression, it's really not recommended for us to be sleepless.

If you're stressed and in need of coping mechanisms, breathing and grounding exercises are all over the internet. My favorite exercise is muscle relaxation.

If you have a medical certificate of your diagnosis, you can even use it to get a PWD card. Depressive disorders are classified under psychosocial disabilities and if you ever find the opportunity to be provided with meds, the 20% discount can help.

So when we sleep and reach the REM cycle, our brain paralyzes our body so we don't act out our dreams and hurt ourselces. But sometimes, things get out of sync. We suddenly wake up during REM while our muscles are still paralyzed so we can't move even if we are fully conscious. This can last for a few seconds to a few minutes.

It is also common to hallucinate or have a bit of difficulty breathing during sleep paralysis. Remember na your body is still in dream mode when you suddenly woke up. So the brain is still actively creating dreams nung nagising ka. This is most likely why we tend to see shadowy figures or other sort of creatures. When I experienced it, I saw a small creature hopping around the room. But it's not real: it's just a hallucination.

As for the choking sensation, like I said, paralyzed pa yung muscles mo so it can really feel like you're choking or that something is sitting on your chest. Your chest muscles may be paralyzed but the diaphragm is still working so you are definitely breathing even if it does feel like you can't.

Now the common reasons why sleep paralysis happens are:

-Excessive fatigue, stress, and/or anxiety
-Not getting enough sleep
-irregular sleep schedules or patterns
-Sleeping on your back

If it happens to you, you just need to relax. I know that sounds cliche but what else can we do, right? Breathe normally and focus on trying to move one body part at a time. I usually start din with my big toe. Once I am able to move it, sunod sunod na yan. Also, try to ignore whatever it is you see. Ako I keep telling myself ""it's not real"". For some, prayer gives them comfort so you can do that too, basta anything that helps you relax.

If it keeps happening, like with your sister, maybe take a look na talaga at your lifestyle or consider seeing a sleep specialist about it.

Hope this helped.","I respect that some of you are believers of the supernatural, but I tend to lean on the scientific.

I rationalize so that I don’t have to rely on memorization, multiple choice, or cue words to answer questions. Its important to understand so that you can apply that knowledge to any situation and derive an answer based on your logic. Its to help you train your brain into working out and remembering details and making connections from different topics to arrive at an answer. For example, if you have a math question that says: 1/2 x 4 and you memorized na if you see a formula like that, the answer is 2. BUT, if you understand the concept of what 1/2 is, then you’ll know na its just taking away half of whatever number its being multiplied to. So congrats! Now you know what 1/2 x <insert no.> is and hindi lang 1/2x4=2! Hopefully, you get the point lol

You may have a completely different course so it all comes down to creating an effective study method that works for you and the material you’ll be covering. Everyone’s got their own special sauce.


Ig to make it quick:
1. Factual info - memorize and connect to overall topic
2. Conceptual info - understand, rationalize, apply
3. Study at the most optimal times (di ka antok, pagod, tamad, or nadidisturb ng fam mo) and manage how you use what time you have on your hands. Prioritize and stay organized! Plan out what youre going to study and when, kse maooverwhelm ka sa dami pala ng books/papers/topics na need mo icover. So make a clear plan and stick to it.
4. Use flashcards and spaced repition
5. If you can, be ahead. Your syllabus is gold. Aim to be ahead of your lectures by 1-2 topics kse personally ako, di nako nakikinig tlga sa lectures, im just mindlessly trying to keep up sa sinasabi by taking notes tas di ko na pala talaga iniintindi. The result? Aaralin ko lahat ule, sayang time. If advanced ka, di ka macracram and may presence of mind ka sa actual lecture to fill in gaps sa knowledge mo and to ask questions and answer them too!
6. TEST YOURSELF OH MY GOD. TEST TEST TEST. ASK CHATGPT TO MAKE IT FOR YOU BASTA YOU HAVE TO TEST YOURSELF A LOT.
7. If youre starting to feel like wala na pumapasok sa review mo, stop. Quality > Quantity. Do something else, come back, try again. Pomodoro if that works for you (25-5,50-10). Dont measure your effectiveness by length but by the quality of work you put out at the end of it. Kaya marerecommend ko, after each study/before moving on to another topic, answer a short quiz or try to recall what you learned. Teach your pet or wall if you have to.
8. Make it interesting. It might be the most boring mathematical piece of shit you’ve ever seen but try to make it interesting. Let chatgpt explain it to you like a five year old and ask it to explain each step with a rationale. if may yt videos na fun, watch that. Find ways to make it easier or bearable for you.
10. If youre a study group kinda person, im all for it! Find people to *actually* study with. Be sure na these people are actually trying though and di lang memang aral please.
11. Know why you’re trying so hard in the first place. Is it to achieve a goal you have? Graduate? Hopefully land a job/internship in the future? 
12. Ask the top students yourself. Be friends with them. Its nice to not be the smartest one in the room because if you are…youre in the wrong room most of the time.

One of my groupmates even had the audacity to post shits sa dump acc n’ya regarding our research despite not having any meaningful contribution . Fortunately and against all odds, I was able to push through and won our group a title of Best in Research.

If class starts at 5 and ends at 8 or 9:30
- will read for an hour and sleep before 10:30

Wake up at 5am
-run or workout

By 7am to 12 pm 
-Readings

12 pm- 1pm
-30’mins nap, 30 mins lunch

1pm - 4pm
-readings & prep for class

4-5pm 
- traveling to school (will insert some reading as i will be driven by someone else)  

Can you give me your insight regarding my planned routine? Will appreciate it so much..

Watching videos right now for tips before going to law school and most are saying that i should be ready for some late night readings huhu




","Planning my daily routine Hello Everyone,

Incoming 1L here in USC, Id love to get your POV on  my planned routine for the upcoming academic year. 

As much as possible, i dont want to sleep late at night cause this affects my mood the following day and once my body get used to it i might have a hard time sleeping at night again.

Demanding ang school when it comes to time but i had classmates who strictly stuck to their routines like doing running or pilates before classes starts.
Stick what works for you and adjust nalang depende sa demands ng profs lalo na pag exams season.
But as what my prof said when we first entered in law school is dont forget to touch some grass.","Incoming 2L at USC

2L na ako this incoming sem but during my 1L, the intensity kinds of ebbs and flows. sometimes merong slow days so i take advantage of it to fit my running sesh or mag walking sa aking dog.

but kapag talagang need mo ma game on at gumawa ng all nighters, youll have to adjust wala kang choice.

good luck OP and welcome to USC!","also agree with this OP. i usually run in the morning before studying but sometimes talagang ma sacrifice mo
